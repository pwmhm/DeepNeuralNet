# DeepNeuralNet (WIP)

This is a Proof of Concept (PoC) Project intended to deepen ones understanding towards the inner workings of a neural network. In essence, this project intends to mimic popular ML libraries such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, MxNet, etc.

The project, at the moment, is not geared towards an efficient representation of a neural network, but rather a working representation.

# Dependencies

TBD

# References

I intend to build this using purely theoretical knowledge of neural network. So this (hopefully) should be an original implementation of NN, however inefficient it is. Theories are largely gathered from Wikipedia, and Andrew Ng Machine Learning Course 1 to 10.
